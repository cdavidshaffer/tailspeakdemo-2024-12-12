# Usage

This is just a quick hack.

1. Create a python virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create image capture directory: mkdir capture
4. Create directory containing your videos (I used sample_inputs)
5. Get an API key from OpenAI and/or Anthropic and store it in your shell environment.
6. Edit the code to point to your sample video.  Modify other configuration variables as needed.
7. Run it: python describe_images.py
